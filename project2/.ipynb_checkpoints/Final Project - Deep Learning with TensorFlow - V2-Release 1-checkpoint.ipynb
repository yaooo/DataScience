We will use the eucledean distance between two images to see the \"distance\" between them. Since we are working in high dimension (784) we can only understand the concept of distance here. We will use the k-means algorithm that was discussed in lecture 12.2 slide 15. You do not need to use TF modules t do this.\n"

    "# Part 3 - First Exercise in Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep Learning has become quite popular in recent times (since 2012) due to its remarkable advances in applications including self driving cars, image recognition, and voice to text conversion. The hello world of deep learning (DL) is long considered to be the exercise that uses of the MNIST hand-written digits dataset that was created by Yann Lecun in 1998. Yann LeCunn who is a professor at NYU and Director of AI at Facebook, just won the 2019 Turing Award for his contributions to Deep Learning. Let us go through a series of exercises to learn how to read, train and validate an image data set. In this case the 60,000 handwritten images of 0-9."
