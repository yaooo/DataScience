The hello world of deep learning (DL) is long considered to be the exercise that uses of the MNIST hand-written digits dataset that was created by Yann Lecun in 1998. Yann LeCunn who is a professor at NYU and Director of AI at Facebook, just won the 2019 Turing Award for his contributions to Deep Learning. Let us go through a series of exercises to learn how to read, train and validate an image data set. In this case the 60,000 handwritten images of 0-9."
